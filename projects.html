        <p style="font-size: 40px;"><u>Three cool projects I've worked on:</u></p></hr>
        <p><u>Monte Carlo Tic Tac Toe</u></p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">We all did this project in CISC 230, but it really stood out to me as a watershed moment 
            in my computer science career. It showed me how easy it was to take advantage of the 
            magic of computers.We had to create a number of "bots" to play a modified version of Tic Tac Toe,
            and these bots varied in difficulty. The hardest bot was supposed to be unbeatable, and it 
            was very interesting to see how it worked.

        <p><u>Noise Reduction</u></p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">This lab is much more recent, completed for my Computer Vision course this fall. We were 
            supposed to create a program that took in "noisy" images and changed their pixel values
            to create a more clear, less "noisy" immage. This lab wasn't overly difficult, but it was 
            very interesting. It showed me that image manipulation is actually pretty fast and fairly
            straightforward.

        <p><u>Risk and Estimation Assessment Neural Network</u></p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">As part of my internship at Mortenson Construction, my team has been tasked with creating
            a machine learning model that can accurately return project completion estimations and
            safety risks based on a number of provided job site factors. Unfortunately, this model isn't 
            my property and I'm not supposed to show it. However, conceptually, I think it's pretty cool,
            and it's been a great experience for me thus far.
